    <p>I felt a bit disingenuous putting this article under the category of "programming", as it's more a discussion of workflows used for programming than actual programming itself. However, can I really justify having an entire category for "workflow"? We shall see.</p>
<p>This time, I'd like to share my experience with <a href="https://github.com/bpython/bpython">bpython</a>, an alternative Python interpreter. I first installed bpython a few months ago, but only started playing around with it today. Up until now, I've only used the standard Python interpreter. While I haven't had any particular problems with it, I've felt like there was a gap in how I worked. As far as I'm aware, there isn't an easy way to edit your session history, or to save the output to a file. As a result, I've only used the Python interpreter to do simple checks of one-line commands. Anything that involves writing a function feels like too much hassle, because I can't edit the history afterwards if I make a mistake, or save it to a file. While it's also possible to do work in vim, I feel as though this lacks the immediacy of using an interpreter.</p>
<p>My other recent go-to has been Jupyter. Being able to whip up graphics quickly and in the same window is a big plus, as is being able to re-run your code after editing it. However, this too is something that I probably wouldn't use if I just need a quick solution to something.</p>
<p>This time, I turned to bpython to help me solve this problem:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A lot of <em>n</em> items contains <em>k</em> defectives, and <em>m</em> are selected randomly and inspected. How should the value of <em>m</em> be chosen so that the probability that at least one defective item turns up is .90?</p>
<p><em>Mathematical Statistics and Data Analysis, Rice, 3Ed</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>I wanted to write a simple function to solve this, but at the same time, I recognised that there might be fiddly bits that I'd have to go back and edit.</p>
<p>I had a tentative go at writing the function line-by-line in the bpython interpreter, and as expected, it didn't work first time. But a quick search of the bpython docs revealed its hidden weapon: press <strong>F7</strong> and you can edit your session history! I fixed the issue with the program and then ran it again (and repeated a few times until it worked properly), and this was the final result:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code><span class="c1">### current bpython session - make changes and save to reevaluate session.</span>
<span class="c1">### lines beginning with ### will be ignored.</span>
<span class="c1">### To return to bpython without reevaluating make no changes to this file</span>
<span class="c1">### or save an empty file.</span>

</code></pre></div>

<p>One of the other cool things is that bpython will show the docstring of a program while you're typing. Here, it's showing the docstring for the program I just wrote:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code><span class="err">&gt;&gt;&gt; check_count(</span>
<span class="err">┌───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐</span>
<span class="err">│ check_count: (Q, n, k)                                                    │</span>
<span class="err">│ Return the number of tests necessary to find one or more of k defective   │</span>
<span class="err">│ items in a lot of size n with probability Q.                              │</span>
<span class="err">└───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>Another interesting thing is the <strong>F8</strong> shortcut, which uploads the session history to a pastebin so you can share it online. Now I've finally gotten started with bpython, I'm excited to explore some of its other features!</p>
