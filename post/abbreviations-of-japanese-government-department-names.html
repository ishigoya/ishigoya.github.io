  <div>
    <p>While translating a text from Japanese to English recently, I encountered the following issue. There was a long sentence containing a list of items, with each followed by an inline reference in brackets to a document from a government department, like this:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code><span class="err">one (link one), two (link two), ...</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>The references looked something like this: <code>平成17年9月16日付薬食審査発第0916001号</code>. Translating this into English presents two challenges. The first is elucidating what <code>薬食審査発</code> refers to. This alone can be difficult. In some cases, the references are to 40-year-old documents produced by the defunct departments of long since re-organised agencies. There is little information about the documents online, or about who produced them. The second issue comes when you find out that the reference refers to <code>the Evaluation and Licensing Division of the Pharmaceutical and Food Safety Bureau</code>. In Japanese, these references don't look particularly out of place, but when I translated my problem sentence into English, the result was quite unwieldy. </p>
<p>Searching online, I found various treatments of this problem. This issue is touched on by translators <a href="https://www.proz.com/kudoz/japanese-to-english/medical-general/4383241-%E5%8E%9A%E7%94%9F%E7%9C%81%E8%96%AC%E5%8B%99%E5%B1%80%E5%AF%A9%E6%9F%BB%E7%AC%AC%E4%B8%80%E8%AA%B2%E9%95%B7%E7%99%BA.html">on this proz.com page</a>. I also tried searching for some actual examples of these references, and found unsurprisingly that they are handled differently in different documents. For example, <a href="http://www.jpma.or.jp/english/parj/pdf/2015.pdf">this JPMA page</a> translates department names in full, but abbreviates agency names:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Notification No. 0922001 of the Evaluation and Licensing Division, PFSB dated September 22, 2005</p>
</blockquote>
<p>while <a href="https://www.pref.kagawa.lg.jp/yakumukansen/yakujinotice/listH24/161_241015.pdf">this translated local government page</a> uses the format:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>December 15, 2000, PMSB/ELD Notification No.1334</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Given that I was translating an inline reference, I decided to make it as brief as possible.</p>
<p>While I was translating the references for this document, I made a list of department names and corresponding English abbreviations that I came across. If I encounter any more in the future, I will add them to this list. Of course, try and confirm these for yourself, I'm just some guy on the Internet.</p>
