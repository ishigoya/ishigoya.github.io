      <p>It sometimes happens that I'm doing something at work, hit an issue, and don't really have the functional reserve (in terms of time, motivation, or ... HP? MP?) to properly deal with it. My usual solution is to spend a few minutes doofing about with it to see if a quick …</p>

      <p>I recently had to start using R for a couple of university courses. Everyone had to write their projects in Rmarkdown, and submit them in both PDF and Rmarkdown format. The past few weeks have been a bit of a blur. I'm also enrolled for an introductory course in R …</p>
